## The ROI Case for Finch

### Per-Home Math
On a $250K home where a buyer normally spends $20K in upgrades:
- **35% increase** (Zonda's published number) = **$7,000 more per home**
- At **50% markup**, that's **$3,500 more profit per home**
- Conservative estimate at 20% increase = **$4,000 more revenue, $2,000 more profit per home**

### Scaled by Builder Volume

| Builder Size | Homes/yr | Additional Revenue (35%) | Additional Profit (35%) |
|-------------|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Small | 50 | $350,000 | $175,000 |
| Medium | 150 | $1,050,000 | $525,000 |
| Large (SM-size) | 500 | $3,500,000 | $1,750,000 |
| Enterprise | 1,000 | $7,000,000 | $3,500,000 |

### Conservative Estimates (20% increase)

| Builder Size | Homes/yr | Additional Revenue | Additional Profit |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Small | 50 | $200,000 | $100,000 |
| Medium | 150 | $600,000 | $300,000 |
| Large (SM-size) | 500 | $2,000,000 | $1,000,000 |

### Key Talking Points
1. **Upgrades are the highest-margin part of the home** — not a side revenue stream
2. **Visualization drives confidence** — buyers who can see it will spend more
3. **35% increase is Zonda's number** — use it as industry validation, not our claim
4. **Even 20% increase pays for Finch many times over** at any volume
5. **No builder has AI-generated visualization** — Zonda uses pre-rendered 3D, not real-time AI

### The Finch Differentiator vs Zonda
- Zonda Envision: enterprise pricing ($50K+), pre-rendered scenes, requires professional photography/3D modeling per plan
- Finch: accessible pricing, AI-generated in real-time, works from a single room photo + swatch images, can be set up in days not months

## Stone Martin Context (Local Benchmark)

- SM buyers choose $8-12K in upgrades on average (this region)
- $42K is considered extreme high end for the market
- SM uses printed PDF option sheets — no visualization
- Kinkade plan has 15 categories, ~50 subcategories, 350+ options
- Our demo covers all of this with AI visualization

The Alabama/Wiregrass market runs lower than national averages on upgrade spend — which means there's more room to grow with the right tools.
