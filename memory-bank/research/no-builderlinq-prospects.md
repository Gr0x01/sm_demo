# Small/Medium Alabama Builders Without BuilderLinq
## Focus: Wiregrass / Dothan / Auburn-Opelika / Montgomery / Gulf Coast
### Research Date: February 19, 2026

---

## Purpose

Identify small-to-medium home builders (roughly 50-500 homes/year) in Stone Martin's operating footprint who likely offer home upgrade/option packages but **lack sophisticated tech backends** like BuilderLinq. These are potential customers for an AI-powered upgrade visualization tool.

## Tier 1: Best Prospects (Right Size, Low Tech, Upgrade Programs)

### Lowder New Homes
- **Location**: Montgomery, Pike Road, Prattville, Millbrook, Auburn, Opelika
- **Founded**: 1956 (~70 years in business)
- **Volume**: ~150-250 homes/year
- **Upgrades**: Full Design Center with selections — floor plans, fixtures, cabinetry, flooring, paint, lighting. Design Team collaborates with buyers. Floor plans by BSB Design.
- **Tech**: Basic brochure website. No online configurator or virtual design center. Selections happen in person.
- **BuilderLinq**: No indication
- **Why prospect**: Largest local builder in Montgomery. Has a structured upgrade program with dedicated Design Center/Team, but relies on in-person/PDF-based selections. 60+ years of traditional methods. Direct SM competitor.

### Harris Doyle Homes
- **Location**: Birmingham, Auburn/Opelika, Pike Road; Panama City FL
- **Founded**: Pre-2010 (acquired by Clayton/Berkshire Hathaway 2017)
- **Volume**: ~200-300/yr; Top 5 Birmingham builder since 2013
- **Upgrades**: Full Design Studio with "hundreds of choices" — kitchen collections, flooring, lighting, specialty trim, light fixtures, cabinets, layout options. In-person design meeting with a designer.
- **Tech**: "Design Studio" page on website appears informational/gallery-based, not interactive. Corporate parent (Clayton) has resources but buyer-facing experience appears traditional.
- **BuilderLinq**: No indication. Clayton may have internal tools but buyer experience is traditional.
- **Why prospect**: Structured Design Studio with dedicated designers, but buyer experience is traditional in-person selection. Clayton backing could be a path to scaling. Competes directly with SM in Auburn-Opelika and Pike Road.

### Conner Brothers Construction
- **Location**: Auburn, Opelika
- **Founded**: Long-established (BBB accredited)
- **Volume**: ~50-100/yr; one of the "Big 3" Auburn-Opelika builders
- **Upgrades**: Likely offers standard upgrade packages but specifics not publicly documented
- **Tech**: Near-zero web presence — only directory listings (BBB, Houzz, BuildZoom). No dedicated website found. Strongly suggests paper/PDF-based everything.
- **BuilderLinq**: Almost certainly not
- **Why prospect**: Top 3 builder in Auburn-Opelika, competes directly with SM, clearly doing volume, but near-zero web presence = very traditional operation. Prime candidate.

### Adams Homes
- **Location**: Statewide AL + SE US (FL, GA, MS, NC, SC, TN)
- **Founded**: 1991 by Wayne Adams
- **Volume**: Builder 100 #31; 40,000+ homes total; ~1,000-1,500/yr nationally
- **Upgrades**: Has a Design Center page (adamshomes.com/design-center). Brand philosophy is "Value, Simplified" — aims to include more standard, reducing need for costly upgrades. Still offers design selections.
- **Tech**: Design Center page requires JavaScript (likely a basic web app). Value/affordability-focused, not tech-forward. No AI visualization or sophisticated configurator.
- **BuilderLinq**: No indication
- **Notes**: Very large footprint but value-focused brand = lean tech investment. May be too large or too "no upgrades needed" in messaging to be ideal first target.

## Tier 2: Wiregrass/Dothan Builders (Smaller but Upgrade-Ready)

### Craftway Homes
- **Location**: Enterprise, Dale/Coffee County (Wiregrass)
- **Founded**: 2006 (third-generation building family since 1962)
- **Volume**: ~20-50 custom homes/yr
- **Markets**: Enterprise, Daleville, Fort Novosel, Level Plains, New Brockton
- **Upgrades**: Full custom process — style, size, budget. Energy-efficient features. Modifies blueprints or creates custom plans.
- **Tech**: Basic website (craftwaycustomhomes.com). No online tools. In-person consultation only.
- **Notes**: Strong military buyer base (Fort Novosel). May be too small for SaaS but represents the Wiregrass builder archetype.

### Omega Builders
- **Location**: Dothan, Wiregrass
- **Founded**: ~2013
- **Volume**: ~10-30/yr (custom, mid-range to high-end)
- **Upgrades**: Specializes in kitchens, bathrooms, outdoor living. High-end cabinetry, trim, home automation, safe rooms. Homes start at $335K+.
- **Tech**: Basic website. No online tools.
- **Notes**: Small volume but high-value homes with significant upgrade potential. Kitchen/bathroom specialization aligns perfectly with visual upgrade tool.

### Southern Home Builders, LLC
- **Location**: Dothan, Wiregrass (Ashford, Cottonwood, Rehobeth)
- **Founded**: 2000 (incorporated 2004) by Scott Childers and Brandy White
- **Volume**: ~10-30/yr ($500K-$1M annual revenue)
- **Tech**: Very basic website (shb1.com). Traditional operation.

### Tolleson Construction
- **Location**: Dothan (serves AL, FL, GA)
- **Founded**: 2001
- **Volume**: Undisclosed; residential + commercial
- **Notes**: Tommy Tolleson named Wiregrass Homebuilder of the Year twice. Respected but traditional.

### BG Homes / Vertical Construction
- **Location**: Enterprise, SE Alabama
- **Founded**: 2003 by Britt Gay
- **Volume**: ~10-30/yr
- **Tech**: Houzz profile only; minimal web presence

### Dilworth Development
- **Location**: Auburn, East AL, Lake Martin
- **Founded**: 1999 (Auburn Building Science grad)
- **Volume**: ~20-50/yr (custom + development)
- **Tech**: Portfolio website, no interactive tools. Named to Pro Builder 40 Under 40 (2019).
- **Notes**: Higher-end custom. Upgrade visualization especially valuable for premium buyers making expensive finish decisions.

## Tier 3: Already Tech-Forward or Too Large

### Holland Homes — HAS VIRTUAL DESIGN CENTER
- **Location**: Auburn, Opelika, Pike Road, Birmingham, Valley, Panama City Beach
- **Founded**: 2006
- **Volume**: ~100-200/yr
- **Tech**: **Already has a custom Virtual Design Center** — buyers can browse floor plans, design selections, and upgrades on their devices. Available across multiple communities.
- **Notes**: More of a competitive example than a prospect. Worth studying their tool.

### BC Stone Homes — CLAIMS TECH DIFFERENTIATION
- **Location**: Auburn, Opelika, East AL / West GA
- **Founded**: 2016 by Bryan Stone
- **Volume**: ~50-100/yr
- **Tech**: Claims "leading edge of technology" with state-of-the-art Sales and Design Studios. Online budget calculator. Extensive design catalog.
- **Notes**: Already positioned as tech-forward. Less likely to need external tools.

### DRB Homes (formerly Knight Homes) — NATIONAL PARENT
- **Location**: Auburn (in AL market); Atlanta, Mid-GA
- **Parent**: DRB Group (acquired Knight Homes)
- **Notes**: Corporate decisions on tech made at HQ level. Less accessible as a local prospect.

### Truland Homes — ACQUIRED BY DR HORTON (2023)
- Was the largest private homebuilder on Alabama Gulf Coast (~500/yr, $244M revenue)
- No longer independent. Now part of D.R. Horton.

## About "DR Homes"

The user mentioned "DR Homes" as an example. No exact match found. Possible interpretations:

1. **D.R. Horton** — Nation's largest builder. Major AL operations (Headland/Dothan, Huntsville, Birmingham, Gulf Coast). Too large.
2. **DRB Homes** (formerly Dan Ryan Builders / Knight Homes) — Operates in Auburn after acquiring Knight Homes. Multi-state.
3. Could be a very small local builder not indexed online, or slight name variation ("D&R Homes," "DR Construction," etc.)

**Action**: Ask user for clarification on exact name or location.

---

## The Upgrade Selection Gap

Most Alabama builders in the 50-300 homes/year range use one of these approaches:

1. **PDF/paper sheets** (most common) — printed option lists with pricing
2. **In-person Design Center/Studio** — physical showroom with samples, guided by a designer
3. **Basic website galleries** — photos of past work, no interactivity
4. **Virtual Design Center** (rare) — only Holland Homes clearly offers this

**No builder found offers AI-generated visualization of upgrade selections.** This is the unique value proposition.

---

## Top Prospects for Outreach

1. **Lowder New Homes** — Largest local competitor, same markets, has Design Center but no tech
2. **Conner Brothers** — Big volume, zero tech, direct SM competitor in Auburn-Opelika
3. **Harris Doyle** — Has Design Studio + scale + Clayton backing for potential enterprise deal
4. **Craftway/Omega/Tolleson** — Wiregrass builders where the tool could differentiate them from SM
