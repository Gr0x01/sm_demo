# UpgradeVision: AI-Powered Home Upgrade Visualization Platform

## Vision Statement

Production home builders lose millions in upgrade revenue because buyers can't see what their choices look like. UpgradeVision replaces printed PDFs and static design centers with an interactive upgrade picker powered by AI-generated room visualizations. Buyers see their exact selections rendered in their actual floor plan — countertops, cabinets, flooring, backsplash — in real time. Builders sell more upgrades with less friction.

## The Problem

- Buyers choose $8-12K in home upgrades from **printed PDFs or physical sample boards** (AL/GA regional; coastal/luxury markets see $30-60K)
- No visual context for how material combinations look together
- No real-time price tracking as they select
- Decision paralysis slows the sales cycle and reduces upgrade revenue
- Physical design centers cost $500K-$2M+ to build and staff
- Existing digital tools (Zonda Envision) use expensive pre-rendered 3D scenes with limited flexibility

## The Solution

An interactive web-based upgrade picker with:
- **All upgrade categories** from the builder's real pricing sheet (cabinets, countertops, flooring, paint, fixtures, appliances, electrical, plumbing, trim, etc.)
- **AI-generated room visualizations** — buyers see their specific material/color selections rendered in photos of the actual floor plan
- **Real-time price tracking** summing all selections
- **Social proof nudges** ("73% of buyers choose this") to drive upsell
- **Swatch images** for every visual option
- **Pre-cached common combinations** for instant display; on-demand generation for unique combos

## Why Now

- Generative AI image quality crossed the threshold for photorealistic interior visualization in 2025
- Cost per AI-generated image dropped below $0.05 (GPT Image 1.5)
- No one is combining generative AI with the production builder upgrade workflow — this is an unoccupied niche
- Zonda Envision (the incumbent) uses traditional 3D rendering — expensive, inflexible, and slow to update

## Market

### Target Customer
- **Production home builders** doing **200-2,000 homes/year**
- Homes in the $250K-$500K range where upgrade revenue is meaningful
- Currently using physical design centers, PDFs, or basic online configurators
- Tech budget: $100K-$400K/year — can absorb $22-34K/year easily

### Market Size
- ~453,000 home building businesses in the US ($170B industry)
- **Target segment** (200+ homes/year): ~2,000-5,000 builders nationally
- **Initial focus**: Southeast US (Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida) — ~200-500 builders
- Even 10 clients at $1-2K/month = strong recurring revenue

### Key Stat
**Zonda Envision reports buyers spend 35% more on upgrades when they can visualize their choices.** In the AL/GA regional market, upgrades average $8-12K per home (not the $30-60K seen in coastal/luxury markets). Our first real test: a frugal investment-property buyer went from $5,500 → $6,400 (+$900, 16% lift) — and they were actively trying to minimize spend. For a builder doing 500 homes/year at $10K avg, even a conservative $900/sale lift = **$450K additional revenue annually**. The tool pays for itself 8x over.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Approach | AI? | Builder-Specific? | Weakness |
|------------|----------|-----|-------------------|----------|
| **Zonda Envision** | Pre-rendered 3D scenes, 225+ brands | No | Yes | Expensive, inflexible, no AI |
| **Constellation Design Studio** | ERP + option management | No | Yes | Workflow tool, no visualization |
| **Spacely AI / HomeDesigns AI** | AI room visualization | Yes | No | Consumer-focused, no builder workflow |
| **UpgradeVision (us)** | AI visualization + builder upgrade workflow | Yes | Yes | **Only player in this space** |

### Our Differentiator
We're the only product that combines:
1. **Generative AI visualization** (not pre-rendered 3D)
2. **Builder-specific upgrade workflow** (real pricing, real options, real floor plans)
3. **Social proof / upsell intelligence** built into the selection flow
4. **Affordable for mid-size builders** ($5-10K setup vs. $50K+ for enterprise solutions)

## Business Model

### Pricing — Two Tiers

#### Tier 1: Production Builder (200+ homes/year)
Per floor plan model. Builders start small and expand as they see results.

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| **Onboarding fee** (one-time, per builder) | $5,000 - $10,000 |
| **Per floor plan setup** | $3,000 - $5,000 |
| **Monthly base** | $500 - $1,000/mo |
| **Monthly per floor plan** | $250/mo per active plan |

**Onboarding covers** (builder-wide, one-time):
- Pricing data transcription from builder's option sheets
- Swatch image sourcing across all visual categories
- Option configuration and category mapping
- Branded frontend build (logo, colors, builder identity)
- Training and onboarding

**Per floor plan covers**:
- Room photography (or collection from builder's existing assets)
- AI image pre-generation (~5,000 images/plan for instant feel)
- Floor plan-specific configuration and testing

**Monthly base ($500-1K, scales with volume) covers**:
- 24/7 platform access for buyers and sales team
- Customer support
- Platform uptime and monitoring
- Infrastructure and storage

**Monthly per plan ($250) covers**:
- On-demand AI image generation for buyer sessions
- Image cache management and storage for that plan
- Option/pricing updates as builder's catalog changes

#### Tier 2: Small Builder (20-200 homes/year)
Base + per plan. No big setup fee — the per-plan model from Tier 1 punishes small builders who have many plans relative to volume (e.g. Craftway: 8 plans, 50 homes/yr = only 3-6 homes per plan).

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| **Setup fee** (one-time, all plans) | $3,000 - $5,000 |
| **Monthly base** | $500/mo |
| **Per plan/mo** | $50/mo per active plan |

**Setup covers**:
- Option/pricing transcription from builder's sheets
- Swatch image sourcing
- Room photography coordination ($500-1,000 for photographer)
- AI image pre-generation for all plans
- Configuration, branding, testing
- ~20 hours of work total

**Monthly base covers**:
- Platform access, hosting, storage, infrastructure
- Admin dashboard login for builder's team to make quick edits
- Support (email, fix within a few days)

**Per plan ($50/mo) covers**:
- Image cache maintenance and storage for that plan
- Option/pricing updates as builder's catalog changes
- On-demand AI generation for buyer sessions on that plan

**Why this tier exists**: A builder doing 50 homes/yr with 8 plans would pay $59K year one on Tier 1 pricing but only generate ~$45K in additional upgrade revenue. Doesn't pencil. Tier 2 at ~$15K year one gives them a 3x return.

#### Pilot Program (First 1-2 builders)
For early adopters / case study builders. Goal is proof, not revenue.

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| **Setup fee** | **Waived** (we eat the ~$1-2K hard costs) |
| **First 3 months** | **Free** |
| **After 3 months** | Standard Tier 2: $500/mo base + $50/plan/mo |

**The pitch**: "I'll set it up for free, you use it for 3 months, and if it's not working you walk away. No setup fee, no commitment. If your buyers are spending more on upgrades after 3 months, we start the monthly."

**Why**: First non-SM builder is worth more as a case study than as revenue. After 3 months of buyers using the tool and seeing upgrade lift, they're not canceling. The data sells the ongoing subscription.

### Revenue Projections

**2026 Goal: 2 builders, 2+ plans each**

| Scenario | Year 1 Revenue | Year 2+ ARR |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **2 builders, 2 plans each (2026 target)** | **$46-60K** | **$24K** |
| 2 builders, 4 plans each | $62-80K | $36K |
| 3 builders, avg 3 plans each | $75-105K | $41-54K |
| 5 builders, avg 3 plans each | $125-175K | $68-90K |

### Builder ROI — Why the Tool Pays for Itself

**Key stat**: Zonda Envision reports buyers spend **35% more on upgrades** when they can visualize their choices. Even at conservative estimates, the math is overwhelming.

**Stone Martin (~500 homes/year, ~$10K avg upgrades)**
Current upgrade revenue: ~$5M/year

*Regional context: In the AL/GA market, $42K in upgrades is considered extremely high. Most Stone Martin buyers spend $8-12K in upgrades. One frugal buyer (investment property, intentionally minimizing) went from $5,500 → $6,400 after using the tool — a $900 lift (16%) from someone actively trying NOT to spend more. Typical buyers spending $10K would likely see $1,200-1,500+ in lift since they're already willing to spend on their home.*

| Buyer Adoption | Per-Sale Lift | Additional Revenue/Year | Annual Tool Cost | **Net Gain** | **ROI** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50% | $900 (floor — frugal buyer) | $225K | $57K | **$168K** | 3.9x |
| 50% | $1,200 (typical buyer) | $300K | $57K | **$243K** | 5.3x |
| 75% | $1,200 (typical buyer) | $450K | $57K | **$393K** | 7.9x |
| 75% | $1,500 (engaged buyer) | $563K | $57K | **$506K** | 9.9x |

At 50% adoption with just the **observed floor lift** ($900, from a frugal investment-property buyer), the tool delivers a **3.9x return**. With typical buyers, **5-10x**.

**Small AL/GA builder (~50 homes/year, ~$8K avg upgrades)**
Current upgrade revenue: ~$400K/year

| Buyer Adoption | Per-Sale Lift | Additional Revenue/Year | Annual Tool Cost | **Net Gain** | **ROI** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50% | $900 (floor) | $22.5K | $9K | **$13.5K** | 2.5x |
| 75% | $1,200 (typical) | $45K | $9K | **$36K** | 5x |
| 75% | $1,500 (engaged) | $56K | $9K | **$47K** | 6.2x |

Even a small builder at conservative adoption clears a **2.5x return** using the floor lift number. At typical lift, **5x**. The question is never "can we afford this?" — it's "does the tool actually move the needle?" That's what the demo proves with real data.

### Handling Objections
- **"That's a lot upfront"** — start with one floor plan for $8K + $750/mo. Prove the ROI, then expand.
- **"Only some of my buyers would use this"** — tables above account for 50% adoption and the math still works
- **"Why does a floor plan cost $3-5K?"** — photography, AI pre-generation of thousands of material combinations, configuration, and testing. Real work, real cost.
- **"What am I paying monthly for?"** — $1K base is 24/7 access and support for your team and buyers. $250/plan covers AI generation and storage for that floor plan.
- **"4x return at worst case"** — for a large builder, even at 50% adoption with the floor lift ($900/sale from a frugal buyer), it's a 3.9x return. With typical buyers, 5-10x.

### Cost Structure

**Pre-generation is non-negotiable.** Each image takes ~60 seconds to generate. Buyers won't wait — the tool must feel instant. That means ~5,000 pre-cached images per plan.

**The pre-cache math:**
- 5,000 images x 60 sec = **83 hours of generation per plan**
- 8 plans (Craftway-sized builder) = **667 hours** (~28 days 24/7)
- At API pricing ($0.04-0.15/image): **$200-750 per plan, $1,600-6,000 for 8 plans**

**Hard costs per builder onboarding:**

| Item | API Pricing | GPU Pricing |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Your time (20 hrs) | — | — |
| Photography | $500-1,000 | $500-1,000 |
| Pre-generation (8 plans x 5K) | $1,600-6,000 | ~$40 |
| Hosting/infra | ~$45/mo | ~$45/mo |
| **Total hard costs** | **$2,100-7,000** | **$540-1,040** |

**Option A: API-based**
- Generation: ~$0.04-0.15/image
- Works for first builder but margins are thin on Tier 2 deals
- Rate limits and 60s generation time make batch pre-gen slow

**Option B: Self-hosted GPU**
- RTX PRO 6000 workstation: ~$10-13K one-time
- Generation cost: ~$0.001/image (electricity only)
- No rate limits — can parallelize, run overnight batches
- Break-even: basically one small builder onboarding in saved API costs

**Recommended path**: Get GPU before first non-SM builder onboarding. The pre-generation costs on API pricing eat most of the margin on Tier 2 deals. A $4K setup fee with $4-6K in API generation costs is underwater. With GPU, that same deal has $3K+ margin.

## Technical Architecture

### Already Built (Stone Martin Demo)
- Next.js 16 web app with step-based wizard UI
- 5-step upgrade flow covering all categories from real pricing PDF
- AI image generation pipeline (Gemini/OpenAI via Vercel AI SDK — model-swappable)
- Supabase image cache (hash-based dedup, CDN-served)
- 166 scraped swatch images
- Real pricing data from Kinkade plan PDF
- Social proof nudges on high-value options
- Two-column sidebar layout with sticky AI image preview
- Mobile responsive

### Multi-Tenant Roadmap
The current architecture supports multi-tenant with minimal changes:
1. **Per-builder config**: pricing data, floor plans, swatch images, branding
2. **Per-builder cache**: Supabase already keys by selection hash
3. **Buyer identification**: already has buyerId-based selection persistence
4. **White-label**: swap logo, colors, builder name
5. **Admin dashboard**: manage builders, view analytics, monitor cache

### Pre-Generation Strategy
For each builder's floor plan portfolio:
- Identify top 5 visual subcategories (countertop, cabinet color, backsplash, flooring, cabinet style)
- Pre-generate top 8-12 options per subcategory = **~5,000-15,000 images per plan**
- Cost: ~$200-600/plan at API pricing, or near-zero with GPU
- Result: **instant visualization for 80-90% of buyer selections**

**[AL/GA Builder Prospect List](research/al-ga-builders.md)**

Highlights:
- **7 builders within driving distance of Montgomery** (Lowder, Goodwyn, Hughston, Holland, Alexander Scott, Trademark, Dilworth)
- **Best first target**: Lowder New Homes — Stone Martin's direct competitor, same city
- **Best timing play**: Alexander Scott Homes — brand new company, building processes now
- **Best intro play**: Centennial Homes (Birmingham) — co-founder is 2025 GBAHB president
- **30+ total prospects** across Montgomery, Birmingham, Atlanta, Huntsville, Gulf Coast
- HBA directory links for ongoing prospecting

## Go-to-Market

### Phase 1: Prove It (Now)
- Stone Martin demo as proof-of-concept (SM is NOT a target customer — they use BuilderLinq for selections already)
- Generate compelling before/after: PDF sheet vs. interactive tool with AI visualization
- Real data point: frugal buyer $5,500 → $6,400 (+$900) after using the tool

### Phase 2: First Paying Builder (Q2 2026)
- Target builders still on PDFs/sample boards — Lowder, Goodwyn, Alexander Scott, Holland, etc.
- Use SM demo to show what their tool would look like, then build theirs
- Deploy with 2 floor plans, measure upgrade revenue impact
- Get testimonial / case study

### Phase 3: Second Builder (Q3-Q4 2026)
- Use first builder's results to close a second builder with 2+ plans
- Demo the actual tool (not a pitch deck) — show their competitor using it
- HBA events, local networking (Greater Montgomery HBA, GBAHB)
- **2026 exit target: 2 builders, 2+ plans each = $46-60K Year 1**

### Phase 1.5: GPU Investment (Before First Non-SM Builder)
- Acquire self-hosted GPU (RTX PRO 6000 or equivalent, ~$10-13K)
- Pre-generation on API is ~$4-6K per small builder and takes weeks of continuous generation
- GPU drops that to ~$40 and enables overnight batch generation
- **Must have before onboarding Tier 2 builders** — API margins don't work at that price point

### Phase 4: Expand & Scale (2027)
- Expand existing builders to more plans (natural upsell)
- Onboard 3-5 total builders
- Attend Southeast Building Conference (SEBC), International Builders' Show (IBS)

## Sales Approach

### The One-Liner
**"I help builders increase upgrade revenue with an AI-powered visualizer that lets buyers see their selections before they commit. It costs a fraction of what the big platforms charge and I can have you up and running in weeks."**

### How to Work a Room (HBA Events, Meetups)
Don't pitch. Have conversations. Ask questions:
- "What's your selection process like?"
- "How do your buyers choose upgrades?"

Let them describe the pain. Then: *"That's interesting — I actually built something for that."* Show them your phone. The demo sells itself.

### Where to Be
- **Home Builders Association of Alabama** — events and meetings
- **Greater Montgomery HBA** — local events
- **Southeast Building Conference (SEBC)**
- **International Builders' Show (IBS)**

These rooms are full of regional builders doing 20-200+ homes/year who know their selection process is clunky but don't have a solution. You'd be the only person with a working product that directly impacts their upgrade revenue.

### Target in These Rooms
Not the nationals (D.R. Horton, Lennar) — they have enterprise solutions. Target the **regional builders doing 20-200 homes/year** who are using PDFs and physical sample boards. They feel the pain every day but think the fix is a $500K design center they can't afford.

## The Pitch (Alternate — For Decks/Written Materials)

**"Your buyers choose $8-12K in upgrades from a printed sheet — we let them see exactly what their kitchen looks like before they sign. In our first test, a buyer who was trying to spend as little as possible still added $900 more after seeing it visualized. Scale that across 500 homes and you're looking at half a million in additional revenue."**
